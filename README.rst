=======
Tikzify
=======

A set of utilities for programmatically generating TikZ code.

Contribution guidelines
=======================

The implementation should be consistent with the surrounding style, be type annotated, and pass the
linters below.

There are a few tools to clean and check the source:

- :bash:`ruff check`
- :bash:`pyright`
- :bash:`mypy`
- :bash:`isort .`
- :bash:`pylint tikzify`

Running
=======

- This macro is helpful for running examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    function dm {
        python "$1.py" $2 && pdflatex -shell-escape $1 && open $1.pdf
    }

- The basal ganglia example can be run by doing :bash:`dm basal_ganglia` from the examples folder.  It should produce :bash:`examples/basal_ganglia.pdf`, which shows all of the output, as well as :bash:`examples/figures/basal_ganglia-*.pdf`, which are the individual diagrams to be included.

- A copy of the `pdf <examples/basal_ganglia.pdf>` is provided.  It shows three programmatically-generated diagrams, with various sections highlighted.
